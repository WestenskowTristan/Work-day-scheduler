# Work-day-scheduler

This webpager is designed for you to have a workday planner between the hours of 9am through 5am.

## How to use.

In the respective time slots on screen you can place text to remind you or let you know you have something to do or get done by said time. Clicking the save button will save that task for you so you can come back to it later!

## Features

This webpage has a couple of neat features, one of which is that past present and future time slots have diffrent colors based on what time it is! Past is gray meaning the time has passed an you dont need to worry about that task anymore, the present is red letting you know this is the hour to get said task dont! The future hours are green indicating you arent needing to do that task right now but its coming up!
